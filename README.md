# Capstone Project – Food Import Forecasting

This project uses regression-based machine learning to forecast national food import values using historical trade and economic data.

Two models are implemented:
- Linear Regression (baseline)
- Random Forest Regressor

Model performance is evaluated using R², RMSE, and MAE.

The notebook focuses on data preparation, model training, and evaluation.  
It is aligned with the accompanying project report and is intended as an analytical artefact rather than a deployed system.
